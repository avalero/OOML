- What's the OOML -

# OOML stands for Object Oriented Mechanics Library. The OOML is a set of tools
written in C++ that allow designers to create mechanical parts using the C++
language.

# OOML applies the model of Object Oriented Programming to Mechanical Designs.
Parts can be inherited from others. A part can join together other existing
parts, and so forth.

# OOML has up to now no external dependency and can be used in any computer
having a standard C++ compiler.

# Up to current version OOML generates OpenSCAD code. Using OpenSCAD designers
may generate the STL of the parts.

# OOML is Open Source, you can use it, modify it, share it.



- What's the intention of the OOML -

# OOML brings together both the design of pieces through code (as it's done with
OpenSCAD) with the programming power of an Object Oriented Language as C++.

# OOML provides a powerful tool for designers to boost their creativity building
mechanical parts. As it uses C++, designers may use any other existing C++
library to calculate, manipulate, create their parts.

# OOML allow designers to create and share their own Parts Libraries, which will
certainly enrich the community.

# Up to current version OOML generates only OpenSCAD code. We are working to
generate also code for other cad programs such as FreeCad, OpenRave, and so
forth.



- Building and Installing OOML -

The OOML uses CMake as cross-platform, open-source build system. To build it
 you need to install it on your computer. Before going on install CMake.

The command for doing so in Debian/Ubuntu/Mint Linux systems is:

$ sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential

The commands to run on the Terminal for building the OOML are:

$ cd ooml $ mkdir build $ cd build $ cmake ../ $ make $ sudo make install

(you need administration privileges)

If you want to unistall the OOML just run from the same directory:

$ sudo make uninstall

(you need administration privileges too)

We are assuming that your ooml code has been uncompressed into a folder called
ooml. If you changed the directory name change it accordingly in the following
instructions.  If you prefer to run the GUI version of CMake you must choose the
CMakeLists.txt file inside your ooml directory and run CMake. The compilation
files generated by CMake must be saved into the/ooml/build/ directory. Then
compile with the make command from terminal.
